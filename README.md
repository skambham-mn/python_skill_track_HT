## Getting Started
First of all, download python from here : https://www.python.org/downloads/ (Windows installation is pretty straight forward, Linux distributions comes with Python 2.7, but you will have to google and setup python 3+ version with some additional steps)

## IDE:
IDE:
Install VS Code from here :https://code.visualstudio.com/  
â€¢	You are free to use any IDE (Atom sublime text, PyCharm, eclipse.. even notepad, if you would like to live dangerously ðŸ˜Š)
â€¢	But VS Code is my pick, its lightweight and offers great functionality
Going forward, when we build specific use cases using python , we would need you local IDE setup to work on.
